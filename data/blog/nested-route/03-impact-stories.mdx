# Impact and Stories

Numbers matter. Stories matter more. Here is how our work can make a difference.

**Lagos literacy circle**
A literacy group used our local-language resources to run adult reading classes. Attendance doubled in six months. Several learners began writing letters and short scripts for local theatre.

**University partnership**
A student team used our dataset on local terms to build a simple chatbot. The bot helps speakers with spelling and local idioms. The dataset is now used in two student projects.

What we measure. We track number of people trained, community partners, usable resources created, and follow-up actions started by communities. We also collect qualitative feedback: confidence, new activities started, and local ownership.

Want to share an impact story with us? Send a short note to `services@tonative.org`. We’ll follow up and, with permission, feature it on our site.
