# Our Story

We started as a small group of friends who cared about language and access to digital tools. We saw people unable to express themselves online in their own languages. We saw kids, elders, and community leaders left out of conversations that should matter to them. So we decided to act.

What we did first. We listened to people. We ran simple workshops. We built small tools that helped a few local groups share content in local languages. Those small wins gave us momentum. More volunteers joined. Grants and partners followed. The work grew, and the impact multiplied.

Why we keep going. We believe technology should not erase culture. It must include it. When people can speak, write, and share in their language, they participate more. They teach. They organise. They solve problems that matter to them.

What matters to us now. Practical projects that give people skills. Tools that preserve language, not replace it. Partnerships that amplify community voice. We measure success not by downloads alone, but by people who can now teach, learn, and lead because of what we built.
