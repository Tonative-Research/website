# 2025 Report

We started in March 2025 as a small group addressing a massive gap: the digital language divide. We saw that in the AI era, African languages were being left behind as "low-resource" afterthoughts. We officially kicked off in May 2025 and became a registered, incorporated language infrastructure company by September.

What we did first. We didn't just talk; we built. We identified datasets and used AI for initial translations, but we knew that wasn't enough. We created a "Human-in-the-Loop" system where our community manually cross-checks and corrects AI outputs to ensure cultural accuracy. By the end of 2025, our registered community of 413 members helped us reach a massive milestone: 51,822 validated sentences across 8 active African languages.

Why we keep going. We believe that for AI to be truly global, it must serve speakers of African languages with the same precision as dominant global ones. Our building blocks—datasets, speech recognition systems, and NLP utilities—are the essential infrastructure for a future where culture is preserved, not erased.

What matters to us now. As we transition into 2026, our goals for next year include hosting public webinars on language infrastructure, migrating to our in-house validation tool, and identifying novel benchmarking datasets to keep pushing the frontier.
