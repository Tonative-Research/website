# Get Involved

We welcome people and organisations who want to help. Here are practical ways to join us now.

Volunteer

- Teach a micro-workshop. Lead a 2-hour session on digital skills or language documentation.
- Mentor. Help a student team build a simple tool or dataset.

Partner

- Community groups. Co-design a pilot project with us in your area.
- Universities. Collaborate on research or student placements.

Donate
We use small, targeted grants to run pilots and pay local coordinators. Even modest gifts cover workshop materials, data collection, and local stipends.
